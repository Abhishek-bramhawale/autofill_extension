here i will be making a small Chrome Extension tool that will simplify the process of filling online forms. Often, users are required to enter the same basic information repeatedly, such as name, age, email, etc. on different websites. extension will allow users to save their basic details once and then automatically fill those details into forms when needed. goal is to make form filling quicker and easier for everyday web users.
